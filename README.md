# امید | Umeed

Welcome to Umeed, the Rural Women Empowerment Marketplace! This marketplace is designed to empower women living in rural areas by providing them with a platform to showcase and sell their products and services.

## About

The Rural Women Empowerment Marketplace aims to bridge the gap between rural women entrepreneurs and potential customers. By creating an online marketplace, we enable these women to reach a wider audience and increase their economic opportunities.

## Features

- **Product Listings**: Rural women can create and manage their product listings, including images, descriptions, and pricing information.
- **Search and Filter**: Customers can easily search for specific products or filter listings based on categories, prices, and other criteria.
- **Seller Profiles**: Each seller has a dedicated profile page where they can showcase their brand, story, and other relevant information.
- **Community Support**: The marketplace fosters a supportive community where sellers can connect (`socket.io` is used for this purpose), share experiences, and seek advice.
